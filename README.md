## 1. Project Overview :smile:
Mindnotez is a note-taking app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed with both functionality and user experience in mind, it allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize notes effortlessly. Beyond plain text, users can also attach images to their notes, making it perfect for both quick memos and visual reminders.

The app features a vibrant and intuitive UI complete with light and dark modes, smooth animations and transitions. Notes can be categorized into favourites, displayed in either a column or row layout, and even ordered in ascending or descending order.

Whether you're organizing ideas, managing tasks, or saving creative inspirations, Mindnotez is built to make note-taking both efficient and enjoyable.
